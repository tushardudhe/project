# AI-IoT-Enabled-Cloud-based-Energy-Management-System
IoT Enabled Power Management device to stop Power theft &amp; extra load usage.
This device will monitor power usage. If the Power usage exceeds against the threshold limit then load will automatically get disconnected, informs to the owner. The Power Supply ratings like Voltage, Current & Power will be stored in the database.
This Hardware Application also predicts Future Power Consumption using Linear Regression Algorithm (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning)
